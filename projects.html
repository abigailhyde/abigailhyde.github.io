            <h1>Temples Timeline</h1>
            <p>
                The Temples Timeline app was featured in the October 2021 edition of <a href="https://byustudies.byu.edu/article/visualizing-temples-through-time/" >BYU Studies Quarterly</a>. 
                The app is available on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.byuh.cis.templevis" class="text-green">Google Play Store</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1529179099" class="text-green">Apple App Store</a>.
                Temples Timeline displays a chronology of temples built by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from 1836 to the present day in a spiral layout, suitable for handheld touchscreen devices.
                I worked on this with Tsz Chin Lam, Litian Zhang, Grace Xie, and our professor Dr. Geoff Draper.
            </p>   

            <h1>BYUH Timeline</h1>
            <p>
                The BYUH Timeline app is a work in progress. It makes use of a similar spiral layout to the Temples Timeline app, this time displaying a history of BYU-Hawaii and the surrounding community of Laie. The timeline is available <a href="https://about.byuh.edu/brief-history">here</a>. The first half of 2021 was spent procuring images for the app, the majority of them coming from the BYU-Hawaii archives.
                I worked on this with Tsz Chin Lam, Litian Zhang, and our professor Dr. Geoff Draper.

            <h1>Speakeasy</h1>
            <p>
                Speakeasy was written for my CS 401 Web Apps Development class at BYU-Hawaii in Fall 2022. Inspired by the now defunct Lang-8 website, Speakeasy allows users to learn language and culture in a fun, social way.
            </p>  
            
            <h1>Henriette</h1>
            <p>
                "Henriette" was my final project for CS 490R at BYU-Hawaii in Fall 2021. "Henriette" tells the story of a mother hen who has lost her chicks. 
                I developed the game over a one month span using Unity. It can be played <a href="./chickenweb/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>, and source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/AbigailHyde/henriette" target="_blank">GitHub</a> along with a downloadable build.
            </p>   

            <h1>"Sunburst Chart: Cremation vs. Burial and Other Disposition Techniques"</h1>
            <p>
                "Sunburst Chart: Cremation vs. Burial and Other Disposition Techniques" was my final project for CS 490R at BYU-Hawaii in Winter 2022. This visualization displays cremation statistics for five countries, making it easy to compare trends over time.
                The dataset and code can be found <a href="https://github.com/AbigailHyde/final_project" target="_blank">here</a>.
                This program was written in Java, and made extensive use of JDBC.
